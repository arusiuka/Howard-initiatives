The Master dataset Howard County Parks and  Planning created by Chike Egbufoama.
 The  dataset contains information on the lands allocated for parks in Howard county and the lands used for parks and other park facilities respectively. The original datasets were published
 in the howard county portal.
 From the original dataset I took out information that partains to lands allocated for parks in Howard county and the lands that are actually parks in Howard county. This includes neighborhood parks,
  community parks and historic parks. It also includes the actual location with address and size  of the parks.
  the dataset is released in the framework of INFM600, information environment, Fall 2015, at the university of maryland ischool, http://ischool.umd.edu/mim.
